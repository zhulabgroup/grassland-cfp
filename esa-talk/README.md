## Plan

For the grassland data, show the three ways to model population and community change:

1. CTI/CPI change over time or between treatments.

1. Weighted regression of species niche centroids.

1. Individual species abundance change regressed against their niche centroids.

Title: Be intentional with model complexity using hierarchical models

Abstract:
Ecological research is increasingly characterized by the collection of fine-scale data, for example, surveying population abundance at the species level and measuring traits at the individual level. Such granularity affords the construction of complex models designed to explain multiple levels of variations, interspecific and intraspecific. Nevertheless, while some ecological processes take place at microscales, some only emerge at macroscales. Therefore, building models that seek to explain variations at the finest level that data allow might not always be the most efficient or powerful. 

We advocate a hierarchical modeling approach that allows us to explicitly consider the scale of the focal ecological process, while accounting for multiple levels of variation with flexibility. We demonstrate this approach with two case studies. In the first case study, we examine shifts in grassland community compositions in response to climate change over time and under experimental manipulations. We build hierarchical models with and without components of interspecific variations. Despite large variations in the abundance of a species in a community, we detect clear signals of thermophilization and xerophilization driven by climate change on the community level. In the second case study, we propose a series of hierarchical models to analyze a multiscale plant trait dataset, under the hypothesis that environmental variables influence plant traits on the individual plant, species, or community scales. We compare models to inform the model complexity suitable to answer the question of the trait-environment relationship.

In summary, we argue that increased model complexity is not an inevitable consequence of increased data granularity. We can intentionally use simple models to address complex ecological problems. Hierarchical models serve as a powerful tool to ensure that we build models at the appropriate scales, free of unnecessary complexity.
